# Agenda for the UMB workshop

Monday, February 20, 08:00 to 17:00 ET<br>
Niklas Korsbo, Julius Martensen, Mohamed Tarek, Andreu Vall

## Introduction and set up <br>
(30 minutes, NK, JM, MT, AV)

- Logging in the UMB JuliaHub instance
- Cloning the WS repository

## Machine learning and neural networks <br>
Lecture (40 minutes, AV) & Hands on (40 minutes, AV)

- Deep learning  (massive data)
- SciML (limited data, combine knowledge and data-driven)
- MLPs
- Regularization and its connection to Gaussian and Laplace priors
- Non-linearities (lower and upper bounded, positive, unbounded)
- Correct specification (design) of a neural network, especially output (for example, bounded non-lin can not work with unbounded data)

## Coffee break <br>
(15 minutes)

## Augmented individual parameters
Lecture (50 minutes, MT) & Hands on (30 minutes, AV)

- "DeepPumas: Combining ML ..." (MT)
- Basic exercises (AV)
- More complete workflow? (AV)

## Scientific machine learning <br>
Lecture (30 minutes, JM) and Hands on (10 minutes, AV)

- Presentation JM
- Basic example (AV)

## Lunch Break <br>
(60 minutes)

## Non-linear mixed effects modeling with DeepPumas
Lecture (30 minutes, NK) & Hands on (30 minutes, AV, NK)

- Lecture (Niklas)
- Basic examples (Andreu)
- Complete example (demo29, demo30? Niklas)
<!-- - How much data is it necessary to fit this (surprisingly little for dynamics; covariates need more though) -->
<!-- - Exercise: try with fewer patients. When does it stop working? fewer / more random effects in iNN -->

## Concluding remarks 
(10 minutes, NK)

<!-- 

## DeepPumas Tumor size modeling – identifying dynamics (60 minutes)

## DeepPumas survival modeling – automatic identification of hazard (45 minutes)

## Coffee Break (15 minutes)

## DeepPumas joint tumor size inhibition and overall survival model – automatic identification of tumor size effect on hazard (60 minutes)
